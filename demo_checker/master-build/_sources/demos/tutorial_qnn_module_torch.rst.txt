   tutorial_qnn_module_tf Turning quantum nodes into Keras Layers

*Author: Tom Bromley â€” Posted: 02 November 2020. Last updated: 28 January 2021.*

Creating neural networks in `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`__ is easy using the
`nn module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html>`__. Models are constructed from elementary
*layers* and can be trained using the PyTorch API. For example, the following code defines a
two-layer network that could be used for binary classification:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-50

**What if we want to add a quantum layer to our model?** This is possible in PennyLane:
:doc:`QNodes <../glossary/hybrid_computation>` can be converted into ``torch.nn`` layers and
combined with the wide range of built-in classical
`layers <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html>`__ to create truly hybrid
models. This tutorial will guide you through a simple example to show you how it's done!

.. note::

    A similar demo explaining how to
    :doc:`turn quantum nodes into Keras layers <tutorial_qnn_module_tf>`
    is also available.

Fixing the dataset and problem
------------------------------

Let us begin by choosing a simple dataset and problem to allow us to focus on how the hybrid
model is constructed. Our objective is to classify points generated from scikit-learn's
binary-class
`make_moons() <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html>`__ dataset:

Defining a QNode
----------------

Our next step is to define the QNode that we want to interface with ``torch.nn``. Any
combination of device, operations and measurements that is valid in PennyLane can be used to
compose the QNode. However, the QNode arguments must satisfy additional :doc:`conditions
<code/api/pennylane.qnn.TorchLayer>` including having an argument called ``inputs``. All other
arguments must be arrays or tensors and are treated as trainable weights in the model. We fix a
two-qubit QNode using the
:doc:`default.qubit <code/api/pennylane.devices.default_qubit.DefaultQubit>` simulator and
operations from the :doc:`templates <introduction/templates>` module.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 93-107

Interfacing with Torch
----------------------

With the QNode defined, we are ready to interface with ``torch.nn``. This is achieved using the
:class:`~pennylane.qnn.TorchLayer` class of the :mod:`~pennylane.qnn` module, which converts the
QNode to the elementary building block of ``torch.nn``: a *layer*. We shall see in the
following how the resultant layer can be combined with other well-known neural network layers
to form a hybrid model.

We must first define the ``weight_shapes`` dictionary. Recall that all of
the arguments of the QNode (except the one named ``inputs``) are treated as trainable
weights. For the QNode to be successfully converted to a layer in ``torch.nn``, we need to provide
the details of the shape of each trainable weight for them to be initialized. The
``weight_shapes`` dictionary maps from the argument names of the QNode to corresponding shapes:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 112-117

In our example, the ``weights`` argument of the QNode is trainable and has shape given by
``(n_layers, n_qubits)``, which is passed to
:func:`~pennylane.templates.layers.BasicEntanglerLayers`.

Now that ``weight_shapes`` is defined, it is easy to then convert the QNode:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-142

With this done, the QNode can now be treated just like any other ``torch.nn`` layer and we can
proceed using the familiar Torch workflow.

Creating a hybrid model
-----------------------

Let's create a basic three-layered hybrid model consisting of:

1. a 2-neuron fully connected classical layer
2. our 2-qubit QNode converted into a layer
3. another 2-neuron fully connected classical layer
4. a softmax activation to convert to a probability vector

A diagram of the model can be seen in the figure below.

.. figure:: /demonstrations/qnn_module/qnn_torch.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

We can construct the model using the
`Sequential <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html>`__ API:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 150-157

Training the model
------------------

We can now train our hybrid model on the classification dataset using the usual Torch
approach. We'll use the
standard `SGD <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.SGD>`__ optimizer
and the mean absolute error loss function:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 162-166

Note that there are more advanced combinations of optimizer and loss function, but here we are
focusing on the basics.

The model is now ready to be trained!

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 204-235

How did we do? The model looks to have successfully trained and the accuracy is reasonably
high. In practice, we would aim to push the accuracy higher by thinking carefully about the
model design and the choice of hyperparameters such as the learning rate.

Creating non-sequential models
------------------------------

The model we created above was composed of a sequence of classical and quantum layers. This
type of model is very common and is suitable in a lot of situations. However, in some cases we
may want a greater degree of control over how the model is constructed, for example when we
have multiple inputs and outputs or when we want to distribute the output of one layer into
multiple subsequent layers.

Suppose we want to make a hybrid model consisting of:

1. a 4-neuron fully connected classical layer
2. a 2-qubit quantum layer connected to the first two neurons of the previous classical layer
3. a 2-qubit quantum layer connected to the second two neurons of the previous classical layer
4. a 2-neuron fully connected classical layer which takes a 4-dimensional input from the
   combination of the previous quantum layers
5. a softmax activation to convert to a probability vector

A diagram of the model can be seen in the figure below.

.. figure:: /demonstrations/qnn_module/qnn2_torch.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

This model can also be constructed by creating a new class that inherits from the
``torch.nn`` `Module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module>`__ and
overriding the ``forward()`` method:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 257-258

As a final step, let's train the model to check if it's working:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 287-290

Great! We've mastered the basics of constructing hybrid classical-quantum models using
PennyLane and Torch. Can you think of any interesting hybrid models to construct? How do they
perform on realistic datasets?
