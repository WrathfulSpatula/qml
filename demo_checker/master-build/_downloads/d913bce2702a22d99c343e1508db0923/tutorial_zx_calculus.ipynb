Posted: 6 June, 2023.*\n\nThe ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum\ncomputations and circuits. Introduced by Coecke and Duncan, it can\nrepresent any linear map, and can be considered a diagrammatically\ncomplete generalization of the usual circuit representation. The\nZX-calculus is based on category theory, an approach to mathematics\nwhich studies objects in terms of their relations rather than in\nisolation. Thus, the ZX-calculus provides a rigorous way to understand\nthe structure underlying quantum problems, using the link between\nquantum operations rather than the quantum operations themselves.\n\n![After this tutorial you will understand how to represent quantum\nteleportation and simplify it in the\nZX-calculus!](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/ZX_Calculus_animation.gif){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nIn this tutorial, we first give an overview of the building blocks of\nthe ZX-calculus, called *ZX-diagrams*, and the rules for transforming\nthem, called *rewriting rules*. We also show how the ZX-calculus can be\nextended to ZXH calculus. The ZX-calculus is also promising for quantum\nmachine learning, thus we present how the parameter-shift rule can be\nderived using ZX-diagrams. We will then jump to the coding part of the\ntutorial and show how PennyLane is integrated with PyZX, a Python\nlibrary for ZX-calculus, and how you can transform your circuit to a\nZX-diagram. We then apply what we\\'ve learned in order to optimize the\nnumber of T-gates of a known benchmark circuit. We also show that\nsimplifying a ZX-diagram does not always end up with a diagram-like\ngraph, and that circuit extraction is a main pain point of the ZX\nframework. This tutorial will give a broad overview of what ZX-calculus\ncan offer when you want to analyze quantum problems.\n\nZX-diagrams\n-----------\n\nThis introduction follows the works of the East et al. and van de\nWetering. Our goal is to introduce a complete language for quantum\ninformation, for which we need two elements: ZX-diagrams and their\nrewriting rules. We start by introducing ZX-diagrams, a graphical\ndepiction of a tensor network representing an arbitrary linear map.\nLater, we will introduce ZX rewriting rules, which together with\ndiagrams defines the ZX-calculus. We follow the scalar convention of\nEast et al. (it is more suitable to the multi-H box situations, see the\nZXH section).\n\nA ZX-diagram is an undirected multi-graph; you can move vertices without\naffecting the underlying linear map. The vertices are called Z- and\nX-spiders, which represent two kinds of linear maps. The edges are\ncalled wires, and represent the dimensions on which the linear maps are\nacting. Therefore, the edges represent qubits in quantum computing. The\ndiagram\\'s wires on the left and right are called inputs and outputs,\nrespectively.\n\nThe first building block of the ZX-diagram is the Z-spider. In most of\nthe literature, it is depicted as a green vertex. The Z-spider takes a\nreal phase $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and represents the following linear\nmap (it accepts any number of inputs and outputs, and the number of\ninputs does not need to match the number of outputs):\n\n![The\nZ-spider.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/z_spider.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nIt is easy to see that the usual Z-gate can be represented with a\nsingle-wire Z-gate:\n\n![The Z-gate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/z_gate.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nAs you\\'ve probably already guessed, the second building block of the\nZX-diagram is the X-spider. It is usually depicted as a red vertex. The\nX-spider also takes a real phase $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and it\nrepresents the following linear map (it accepts any number of inputs and\noutputs):\n\n![The\nX-spider.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/x_spider.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nIt is easy to see that the usual X-gate can be represented with a\nsingle-wire X-spider:\n\n![The X-gate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/x_gate.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nFrom ordinary quantum theory, we know that the Hadamard gate can be\ndecomposed into X and Z rotations, and can therefore be represented in\nZX-calculus. In order to make the diagram easier to read, we introduce\nthe Hadamard gate as a yellow box:\n\n![The Hadamard gate as a yellow box and its ZX\ndecomposition.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/hadamard_gate.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nThis yellow box is also often represented as a blue edge in order to\nfurther simplify the display of the diagram. Below, we will discuss a\ngeneralization of the yellow box to a third spider, forming the\nZXH-calculus. It is important to note that the yellow box is by itself a\nrewrite rule for the decomposition of the Hadamard gate. The yellow box\nallows us to write the relationship between the X- and Z-spider as\nfollows.\n\n![How to transform an X-spider to a Z-spider with the Hadamard\ngate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/hxhz.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\n![How to transform an Z-spider to a X-spider with the Hadamard\ngate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/hzhx.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nA special case of the Z- and X-spiders are diagrams with no inputs (or\noutputs). They are used to represent states that are unnormalized. If a\nspider has no inputs and outputs, it simply represents a complex scalar.\nYou can find the usual representation of quantum states below:\n\n![The zero state and plus state as a\nZX-diagram.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/zero_state_plus_state.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nSimilarly, you get the $\\vert 1\\rangle$ state and $\\vert -\\rangle$ state\nby replacing the zero phase with $\\pi$.\n\nThe phases are $2\\pi$ periodic, and when a phase is equal to $0$ we omit\nthe zero symbol from the spider. A simple green vertex is a Z-spider\nwith zero phase and a simple red vertex is an X-spider with zero phase.\n\nNow that we have these two basic building blocks, we can start composing\nthem and stacking them on top of each other. Composition consists of\njoining the outputs of a diagram to the inputs of another diagram.\nStacking two ZX-diagrams on top of each other represents the tensor\nproduct of the corresponding tensors.\n\nWe illustrate the rules of stacking and composition by building an\nequivalent CNOT gate (up to a global phase). We start by stacking a\nsingle wire with a phaseless Z-spider with one input wire and two output\nwires. We show the ZX-diagram and corresponding matrix below:\n\n![Phaseless Z-spider with one input wire and two output wires (see the\ndefinition of the Z-spider) stacked with a single\nwire.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/stack_z_w.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nNext, we stack a single wire with a phaseless X-spider with two input\nwires and single output wire. Again, we provide the matrix:\n\n![Single wire stacked with a phaseless X-spider with two inputs wires\nand one output\nwire.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/stack_w_x.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nFinally, we compose the two diagrams, meaning that we join the two\noutputs of the first diagram with the two inputs of the second diagram.\nBy doing this we obtain a CNOT gate --- you can convince yourself by\ndoing the matrix multiplication between the two diagrams.\n\n![The composition of the two diagrams is a CNOT\ngate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/compose_zw_wx.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nWe\\'ve already mentioned that a ZX-diagram is an undirected multi-graph;\nthe position of the vertices does not matter, nor does the trajectory of\nthe wires. We can move vertices around, bend and unbend, and cross and\nuncross wires as long as the connectivity and the order of the inputs\nand outputs is maintained. In particular, bending a line so that it\nchanges direction from left to right, or vice-versa, is not allowed.\nNone of these deformations affect the underlying linear map, meaning\nthat ZX-diagrams have all sorts of *topological* symmetries. For\ninstance, the two diagrams below both represent the CNOT gate:\n\n![Both diagrams represent the same CNOT\ngate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/cnot_moved.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nThis means that we can draw a vertical line without ambiguity, which is\nthe usual way of representing the CNOT gate:\n\n![Usual representation of the CNOT gate as a\nZX-diagram.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/cnot.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nWe\\'ve just shown that we can express any Z rotation and X rotation with\nZ- and X-spiders. Therefore, it is sufficient to create any one-qubit\nrotation on the Bloch sphere. By composing and stacking, we can also\ncreate the CNOT gate. Therefore, we have a universal gate set! We can\nalso create the $0$ state and $+$ state on any number of qubits.\nTherefore, we can represent any quantum state. Normalization might be\nneeded (e.g., for the CNOT gate) and we perform this by adding complex\nscalar vertices.\n\nIt turns out that the ability to represent an arbitrary state implies\nthe ability to represent an arbitrary linear map. Using a mathematical\nresult called the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, for any linear map $L$\nfrom $n$ to $m$ wires, we can bend the incoming wires to the right and\nfind an equivalent state on $n + m$ wires. Thus, any linear map is\nequivalent to some state, and since we can create any state, we can\ncreate any map! This shows that ZX-diagrams are a universal tool for\nreasoning about linear maps. But this doesn\\'t mean the representation\nis simple!\n\nFor a more in-depth introduction, see and.\n\nZX-calculus: rewriting rules\n----------------------------\n\nZX-diagrams coupled with rewriting rules form the ZX-calculus.\nPreviously, we presented the rules for composing and stacking diagrams\nand talked about the topological symmetries corresponding to\ndeformations. In this section, we provide rewriting rules that can be\nused to simplify diagrams without changing the underlying linear map.\nThis can be very useful for quantum circuit optimization and for showing\nthat some computations have a very simple form in the ZX framework\n(e.g., teleportation).\n\nIn the following rules, the colours are interchangeable.\n\n1.  Since the X-gate and Z-gate do not commute, non-phaseless vertices\n    of different color do not commute.\n\n2.  The **fuse** rule applies when two spiders of the same type are\n    connected by one or more wires. We can fuse spiders by simply adding\n    the two spiders\\' phases and removing the connecting wires.\n\n    ![The (f)use\n    rule.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/f_rule.jpeg){.align-center\n    width=\"70.0%\"}\n\n3.  The $\\pi$ **-copy** rule describes how to pull an X-gate through a\n    Z-spider (or a Z-gate through an X-spider). Since X and Z\n    anticommute, pulling the X-gate through a Z-spider introduces a\n    minus sign into the Z phase.\n\n    ![The ($\\pi$)-copy\n    rule.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/pi_rule.jpeg){.align-center\n    width=\"70.0%\"}\n\n4.  The **state-copy** rule captures how simple one-qubit states\n    interact with a spider of the opposite colour. It is only valid for\n    states that are multiples of $\\pi$ (therefore $a$ is an integer), so\n    we have computational basis states (in the X or Z basis). Basically,\n    if you pull a basis state through a spider of the opposite color, it\n    copies it onto each outgoing wire.\n\n    ![The state (c)opy rule, where $a$ is an\n    integer.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/c_rule.jpg){.align-center\n    width=\"70.0%\"}\n\n5.  The **identity** rule states that phaseless spiders with one input\n    and one output are equivalent to the identity and can therefore be\n    removed. This is similar to the rule that Z and X rotation gates,\n    which are phaseless, are equivalent to the identity. This rule\n    provides a way to get rid of self-loops.\n\n    ![The (id)entity removal\n    rule.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/id_rule.jpeg){.align-center\n    width=\"70.0%\"}\n\n6.  A **bialgebra** is a mathematical structure with a product\n    (combining two wires into one) and a coproduct ( splitting a wire\n    into two wires) where, roughly speaking, we can pull a product\n    through a coproduct at the cost of doubling. This is similar to the\n    relation enjoyed by the XOR algebra and the COPY coalgebra. This\n    rule is not straightforward to verify and details can be found in .\n\n    ![The (b)ialgebra\n    rule.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/b_rule.jpg){.align-center\n    width=\"70.0%\"}\n\n7.  The **Hopf** rule is a bit like the bialgebra rule, telling us what\n    happens when we try to pull a coproduct through a product. Instead\n    of doubling, however, they decouple, leaving us with an unconnected\n    projector and a state. Again, this relation is satisfied by XOR and\n    COPY, and the corresponding algebraic structure is called a Hopf\n    algebra. This turns out to follow from the bialgebra and the\n    state-copy rule, but it\\'s useful to record it as a separate rule.\n\n    ![The (ho)pf\n    rule.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/hopf_rule.jpeg){.align-center\n    width=\"70.0%\"}\n\nTeleportation\n-------------\n\nNow that we have all the necessary tools, let\\'s see how to describe\nteleportation as a ZX-diagram and simplify it with our rewriting rules.\nThe results are surprisingly elegant! We follow the explanation from.\nYou can find an introduction to teleportation in [the MBQC\ndemo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_mbqc.html).\n\nTeleportation is a protocol for transferring quantum information (a\nstate) from Alice (the sender) to Bob (the receiver). To perform this,\nAlice and Bob first need to share a maximally entangled state. The\nprotocol for Alice to send her quantum state to Bob is as follows:\n\n1.  Alice applies the CNOT gate followed by the Hadamard gate.\n2.  Alice measures the two qubits that she has.\n3.  Alice sends the two measurement results to Bob.\n4.  Given the results, Bob conditionally applies the Z- and X-gate to\n    his qubit.\n5.  Bob ends up with the same state as Alice previously had.\n    Teleportation is complete!\n\nIn the ordinary quantum circuit notation, we can summarize the procedure\nas follows:\n\n![The teleportation\ncircuit.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/teleportation_circuit.jpeg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nLet us convert this quantum circuit into a ZX-diagram. The measurements\nare represented by the state X-spider parameterized with boolean\nparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The cup represents the maximally\nentangled state shared between Alice and Bob. As you might expect from\nearlier comments about bending wires, their shared state is\nChoi-Jamiolkowski-equivalent to the identity linear map.\n\nLet\\'s simplify the diagram by applying some rewriting rules. The first\nstep is to fuse the $a$ state with the X-spider of the CNOT. We also\nmerge the Hadamard gate with the $\\beta$ state, because together it\nrepresents a Z-spider. Then we can fuse the three Z-spiders by simply\nadding their phases. After that, we see that the Z-spider phase vanishes\n(modulo $2\\pi$) and can therefore be simplified using the identity rule.\nThen we can fuse the two X-spiders by adding their phases. We notice\nthat the phase again vanishes modulo $2\\pi$ and we can get rid of the\nlast X-spider. Teleportation is a simple wire connecting Alice and Bob!\n\n![The teleportation ZX-diagram simplified from but there is a scalar\nfactor because of a different scalar convention. You are now able to\nunderstand, step by step, the teleportation gif from the beginning of\nthis\ntutorial!](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/teleportation.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nThe ZXH-calculus\n----------------\n\nThe universality of the ZX-calculus does not guarantee the existence of\na simple representation, even for simple linear maps. For example, the\nToffoli gate (the quantum AND gate) requires around 25 spiders (Z and\nX)! We previously introduced the Hadamard gate as a yellow box, which\nmotivates the introduction of a new generator: the multi-leg H-box,\ndefined as follows:\n\n![The H-box, a third\ngenerator.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/h_box.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nThe parameter $a$ can be any complex number, and the sum is over all\n$i_1, ... , i_m, j_1, ... ,\nj_n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Therefore, an H-box represents a matrix where its\nentries are equal to $1$ except for the bottom right element, which is\n$a$. This will allow us to concisely express the Toffoli gate, as we\nwill see shortly.\n\nAn H-box with one input wire and one output wire, with $a=-1$, is a\nHadamard gate up to global phase. Thus, we omit the parameter when it is\nequal to $-1$. The Hadamard gate is sometimes represented by a blue edge\nrather than a box.\n\nThanks to the introduction of the multi-leg H-box, the Toffoli gate can\nbe represented with three Z-spiders and three H-boxes --- two simple\nHadamard gates and one three-ary H-box --- as shown below:\n\n![Toffoli](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/toffoli.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nThe addition of the multi-leg H-box together with an additional set of\nrewriting rules forms the ZXH-calculus. You can find more details and\nthe rewriting rules in the literature.\n\nLet\\'s show that this ZXH-diagram is indeed a Toffoli-gate. This\noperation is defined by conditionally applying an X-gate on the target\nwire, it means that only the state $|110\\rangle$ and $|111\\rangle$ will\nnot map to themselves ($|110\\rangle$ to $|111\\rangle$ and $|111\\rangle$\nto $|110\\rangle$). We will show that if one provides the state\n$|11\\rangle$ on the two first wires, it results to a bit flip on the\nthird wire (X-gate). For that purpose, we need to add a new rewriting\nrule that is part of the ZXH-calculus: the **absorb** rule.\n\n![The (ab)sorb\nrule.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/absorb.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nWe start by applying our Toffoli diagram on a $|11\\rangle$ state, which\ncorresponds to two X-spiders with a phase of $\\pi$ stacked with our\ndiagram. We apply the copy rule on the two groups of X-spiders and\nZ-spiders on the wires 0 and 1. After that we can apply the newly\nintroduced absorb rule on one of the X-spiders connected to the H-Box.\nThen we recognize the Fourier relation and can replace the X-spider and\nH-Box by a Z-spider. Then it is easy to apply the fuse rule on the two\nZ-spiders. Again, we recognize the Fourier relation and obtain a single\nX-spider on the target wire. We just proved that by providing the\n$|11\\rangle$ state on the two control wires, it always applies an\nX-spider on the target. It means that we have a bit flip on the target.\n\n![Toffoli-diagram applied on the $|11\\rangle$\nstate.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/11ccnot.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nIf you do the same procedure with the others states on the two controls\n($|00\\rangle$, $|11\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$) with slightly\ndifferent rules (the explosion rule), you will always end up with an\nempty target and identical states for the controls. We then have proved\nthat our ZXH-diagram is indeed the Toffoli gate!\n\nThe ZX-calculus for quantum machine learning\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe now move away from the standard use of the ZX-calculus in order to\nshow its utility for calculus and, more specifically, for quantum\nderivatives ([the parameter-shift\nrule](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift.html)). What\nfollows is not implemented in PennyLane or PyZX. By adding derivatives\nto the framework, it shows that the ZX-calculus has a role to play in\nanalyzing quantum machine learning problems. After reading this section,\nyou should be convinced that the ZX-calculus can be used to study any\nkind of quantum-related problem.\n\nIndeed, not only is the ZX-calculus useful for representing and\nsimplifying quantum circuits, but it was shown that we can use it to\nrepresent gradients and integrals of parameterized quantum circuits . In\nthis section, we will follow the proof of the theorem that shows how the\nderivative of the expectation value of a Hamiltonian given a\nparameterized state can be derived as a ZX-diagram (theorem 2 of Zhao et\nal.). We will also show that the theorem can be used to prove the\nparameter-shift rule!\n\n### Partial derivative as a ZX-diagram\n\nLet\\'s first describe the problem. Without loss of generalization,\nlet\\'s suppose that we begin with the pure state $|0\\rangle$ on all $n$\nqubits. Then we apply a parameterized unitary $U$ that depends on $\\vec{\n\\theta}=(\\theta_1, ..., \\theta_m)$, where $\\theta_i \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nConsequently, the expectation value of a Hamiltonian $H$ is given by:\n\n$$\\langle H \\rangle = \\langle 0 | U(\\vec{\\theta}) H U(\\vec{\\theta})^{\\dagger} |0 \\rangle.$$\n\nWe have seen that any circuit can be represented by a ZX diagram, but\nonce again, we want to use the graph-like form (see the Graph\noptimization and circuit extraction section). There are multiple rules\nthat ensure the transformation to a graph-like diagram. We replace the 0\nstate by red phaseless spiders, and we transform the parameterized\ncircuit to its graph-like ZX diagram. We call the obtained diagram\n$G_U(\\vec{\\theta})$, this diagram is equal to the unitary up to a\nconstant $c$.\n\n![](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/hamiltonian_diagram.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nNow we will investigate the partial derivative of the diagram\nrepresenting the expectation value. The theorem is the following:\n\n![Theorem 2: The derivative of the expectation value of a Hamiltonian\ngiven a parameterized as a\nZX-diagram.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/theorem2.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nLet\\'s prove theorem 2, and first we consider a partial derivative on\nthe spider with respect to $\\theta_j$. The spider necessarily appears on\nboth sides, but they have phases of opposite signs and inverse\ninputs/outputs. By simply writing their definitions and expanding the\nformula, we obtain:\n\n![Two Z-spiders depending on the $j$-th\nangle.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/symmetric_spiders.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nNow we have a simple formula where we can easily take the derivative:\n\n![The derivative of two spiders depending on the $j$-th\nangle.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/derivative_symmetric_spiders.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nThe theorem 2 is proved --- we just expressed the partial derivative as\na ZX-diagram!\n\n### Parameter-shift rule as a ZX-diagram\n\nThis theorem can be used to prove the parameter-shift rule. Let\\'s\nconsider the following ansatz that we transform to its graph-like\ndiagram.\n\n![The circuit (on the left) is translated to a\nZX-diagram.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/param_shift_1_0.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\n![The whole circuit is translated to a graph-like\nZX-diagram.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/param_shift_1_1.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nWe then apply the previous theorem to get the partial derivative\nrelative to $\\theta_1$.\n\n![The derivative is applied on the\nZX-diagram](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/param_shift_1_2.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nThe second step is to take the X-spider with phase $\\pi$ and explicitly\nwrite the formula $|+\\rangle\\langle +|\n- |-\\rangle \\langle -|$. We can then separate the diagram into two parts\nby recalling the definition of the $|+\\rangle$ (phaseless Z-spider) and\n$|- \\rangle$ ($2\\pi$ Z-spider) states and using the fusion rule for the\nZ-spider. We obtain the parameter-shift rule!\n\n![By using theorem 2, we can add an X-spider and shift the phases in the\nZ-spiders. Then, by explicitly decomposing the spider with the\n$|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ states, we prove the parameter-shift\nrule!](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/param_shift_2.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nYou can find more information about the differentiation and integration\nof ZX-diagrams with QML applications in the following paper.\n\nZX-diagrams with PennyLane\n--------------------------\n\nNow that we have introduced the formalism of the ZX-calculus, let\\'s\ndive into some code and show what you can do with PennyLane! PennyLane\nv0.28 added ZX-calculus functionality to the fold. You can use the\n`~.pennylane.transforms.to_zx`{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"} transform\ndecorator to get a ZX-diagram from a PennyLane\n`~.pennylane.QNode`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}, while\n`~.pennylane.transforms.from_zx`{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"}\ntransforms a ZX-diagram into a PennyLane tape. We are using the PyZX\nlibrary under the hood to represent the ZX diagram. Once your circuit is\na PyZX graph, you can draw it, apply some optimization, extract the\nunderlying circuit, and go back to PennyLane.\n\nLet\\'s start with a very simple circuit consisting of three gates and\nshow that you can represent the `~.pennylane.QNode`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} as a PyZX diagram:\n"

        "We get a tape corresponding to the randomly generated circuit that we\ncan use in any `~.pennylane.QNode`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}. This\nfunctionality will be very useful for our next topic: circuit\noptimization.\n\nDiagram optimization and circuit extraction\n===========================================\n\nThe ZX-calculus is more general and more flexible than the usual circuit\nrepresentation. We can therefore represent circuits with ZX-diagrams and\napply rewriting rules to simplify them --- like we did for\nteleportation. But, not every ZX-diagram has a corresponding circuit. To\nget back to circuits, a method for circuit extraction is needed. For a\nrigorous introduction to this active and promising field of application,\nsee. The basic idea is captured below:\n\n![The simplification and extraction of ZX-diagrams, content from page 2\nof.](../demonstrations/zx_calculus/circuit_opt.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nTo simplify ZX-diagrams, not only can we use the rewriting rules defined\npreviously, but we can also use graph-theoretic transformations called\nlocal complementation and pivoting. These are special transformations\nthat can only be applied to \\\"graph-like\\\" ZX-diagrams. As defined in, a\nZX-diagram is graph-like if\n\n1.  All spiders are Z-spiders.\n2.  Z-spiders are only connected via Hadamard edges.\n3.  There are no parallel Hadamard edges or self-loops.\n4.  Every input or output is connected to a Z-spider and every Z-spider\n    is connected to at most one input or output.\n\nA ZX-diagram is called a graph state if it is graph-like: every spider\nis connected to an output and there are no phaseless spiders.\nFurthermore, it was proved that every ZX-diagram is equal to a\ngraph-like ZX-diagram. Thus, after conversion into graph-like form, we\ncan use graph-theoretic tools on all ZX-diagrams.\n\nThe basic idea is to use the graph-theoretic transformations to get rid\nof as many interior spiders as possible. Interior spiders are the one\nwithout inputs or outputs connected to them. We introduce some names for\nthe spiders depending on their phases:\n\n1.  A Pauli spider has a phase that is a multiple of $\\pi$.\n2.  A Clifford spider has a phase that is a multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n3.  A proper Clifford spider is a Clifford spider with a phase which is\n    an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nTheorem 5.4 in provides an algorithm which takes a graph-like diagram\nand performs the following:\n\n1.  Remove all interior proper Clifford spiders,\n2.  Remove adjacent pairs of interior Pauli spiders,\n3.  Remove interior Pauli spiders adjacent to a boundary spider.\n\nThis procedure is implemented in PyZX as the\n`~.pyzx.full_reduce`{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"} function. The\ncomplexity of the procedure is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the\nnumber of spiders. Let\\'s create an example with the circuit\n[mod\\_5\\_4](https://github.com/njross/optimizer/blob/master/Arithmetic_and_Toffoli/mod5_4_before).\nThe circuit $63$ gates: $28$ `~.pennylane.T`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"}. gates, $28$ `~.pennylane.CNOT`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"}, $6$ `~.pennylane.Hadamard`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} and $1$ `~.pennylane.PauliX`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"}.\n"

There are\ntwo different algorithms introduced in the same paper. First, for\nClifford circuits, the procedure will erase all interior spiders, and\nthe diagram is left in a graph-state from which a Clifford circuit can\nbe extracted using a total of eight layers with only one layer of CNOTs.\n\nFor non-Clifford circuits, the problem is more complex because we are\nleft with non-Clifford interior spiders. From the diagram produced by\nthe simplification procedure, the extraction progresses through the\ndiagram from right-to-left, consuming gates on the left and adding gates\non the right. It produces better results than other cut-and-resynthesize\ntechniques. The extraction procedure is implemented in PyZX as the\nfunction `pyzx.circuit.extract_circuit`.

We have proved its utility for\noptimizing quantum circuits and shown that the ZX-calculus is more than\npromising for quantum machine learning. It was not covered in this\nintroduction, but the ZX-calculus can also be used for quantum-error\ncorrection --- it\\'s no wonder why some quantum physicists call\nZX-calculus the \\\"Swiss army knife\\\" of quantum computing tools!\n\nAcknowledgement\n===============\n\nThe author would also like to acknowledge the helpful inputs of Richard\nEast, David Wakeham and Isaac De Vlugt.
