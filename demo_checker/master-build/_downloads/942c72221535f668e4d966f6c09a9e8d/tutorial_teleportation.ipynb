        "Quantum Teleportation\n=====================\n\nThis tutorial walks you through a popular quantum information technique\nknown as *quantum teleportation*. While teleportation has been thought\nof as the stuff of sci-fi legend, we are going to prove that it is\nactually already possible today! The technique leverages many\nfoundational principles of quantum computing, and it has lots of useful\napplications across the entire field. These principles include (but are\nnot limited to): the no-cloning theorem, quantum entanglement, and the\nprinciple of deferred measurement. Let\\'s dive in!\n\n| \n\n![](../demonstrations/teleportation/socialthumbnail_large_Quantum_Teleportation.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\n| \n\nGoal: Transferring Quantum Information\n--------------------------------------\n\nSuppose there are two researchers named Alice and Bob, and Alice wants\nto send her quantum state to Bob. The quantum teleportation protocol\nenables Alice to do exactly this in a very elegant manner, and it can be\ndescribed in four steps:\n\n1\\. State preparation: Alice initializes her qubit to the state she\nwishes to teleport.\n\n2\\. Shared entanglement: A Bell state is created and distributed to\nAlice and Bob (one qubit each).\n\n3\\. Change of basis: Alice converts her two qubits from the Bell basis\nto the computational basis.\n\n4\\. Measurement: Alice measures her two qubits, then tells Bob how to\nconvert his qubit to obtain the desired state. Note that it is only\nquantum *information* being teleported, and not a physical particle.\n\nAn overview of the protocol can be seen here:\n\n![](../demonstrations/teleportation/teleport_circuit_full_text.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nProblem: The No-Cloning Theorem\n-------------------------------\n\nYou might be wondering why we need to teleport a state at all. Can\\'t\nAlice just make a copy of it and send the copy to Bob? It turns out that\ncopying arbitrary states is *prohibited*, which you can understand using\nsomething called the **no-cloning theorem**. The proof is surprisingly\nstraightforward. Suppose we would like to design a circuit (unitary\ntransformation) $U$ that can perform the following action:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{align*}\nU(\\vert \\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\vert s\\rangle ) &= \\vert \\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\vert \\psi\\rangle, \\\\\nU(\\vert \\varphi\\rangle \\otimes \\vert s\\rangle ) &= \\vert \\varphi \\rangle \\otimes \\vert \\varphi \\rangle,\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere $\\vert \\psi\\rangle$ and $\\vert \\varphi\\rangle$ are arbitrary,\nnormalized single-qubit states, and $\\vert s \\rangle$ is some arbitrary,\nnormalized starting state. We will now prove that no such $U$ exists!\n\nFirst, let\\'s take the inner product of the left-hand sides of the two\nequations:\n\n$$(\\langle \\psi \\vert \\otimes \\langle s \\vert) U^\\dagger U(\\vert \\varphi\\rangle \\otimes \\vert s\\rangle ) = \\langle \\psi \\vert \\varphi\\rangle \\  \\langle s \\vert s\\rangle$$\n\nSince $\\langle s \\vert s\\rangle$ equals 1, this evaluates to\n$\\langle \\psi \\vert \\varphi \\rangle$. Next, we compare the inner product\nof the right-hand sides of the two equations:\n$(\\langle \\psi \\vert \\varphi \\rangle)^2$. These inner products must be\nequal, and they are only equal if they are a value that squares to\nitself. The only valid values for the inner product then are 1 and 0.\nBut if the inner product is 1, the states are the same; on the other\nhand, if the inner product is 0, the states are orthogonal. Therefore,\nwe can\\'t clone arbitrary states!\n\nSolution: Quantum Teleportation\n-------------------------------\n\nWe will now walk through how to share quantum information without\ncloning it, one step at a time.\n"

State preparation\n====================\n\n![](../demonstrations/teleportation/teleport_circuit_state_preparation.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nTeleportation involves three qubits. Two of them are held by Alice, and\nthe third by Bob. We\\'ll denote their states using subscripts:\n\n1.  $\\vert\\cdot\\rangle_S$, Alice\\'s first qubit that she will prepare in\n    some arbitrary state\n2.  $\\vert\\cdot\\rangle_A$, Alice\\'s auxiliary (or \\\"ancilla\\\") qubit\n    that she will entangle with Bob\\'s qubit for communication purposes\n3.  $\\vert \\cdot\\rangle_B$, Bob\\'s qubit that will receive the\n    teleported state\n\nTogether, their starting state is:\n\n$$\\vert 0\\rangle_S \\vert 0\\rangle_A \\vert 0\\rangle_B.$$\n\nThe first thing Alice does is prepare her first qubit in whichever state\n$\\vert\n\\psi\\rangle$ that she\\'d like to send to Bob so that their combined\nstate becomes:\n\n$$\\vert \\psi\\rangle_S \\vert 0\\rangle_A \\vert 0\\rangle_B.$$\n\nWe can use the following [quantum\nfunction](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/circuits.html#quantum-functions)\nto do the state preparation step:\n"

Shared entanglement\n======================\n\n![](../demonstrations/teleportation/teleport_circuit_entanglement.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nThe reason why teleportation works is the use of an *entangled state* as\na shared resource between Alice and Bob. You can imagine some process\nthat generates a pair of entangled qubits, and sends one qubit to each\nparty. For simplicity (and simulation!), we will represent the\nentanglement process as part of our circuit.\n\nEntangling the qubits $A$ and $B$ leads to the combined state:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( \\vert \\psi\\rangle_S \\vert 0\\rangle_A \\vert 0\\rangle_B + \\vert \\psi\\rangle_S \\vert 1\\rangle_A \\vert 1\\rangle_B \\right)\\tag{1}$$\n\nThe $AB$ subsystem is now in what is known as a *Bell state*. There are\nfour maximally entangled two-qubit Bell states, and they form the Bell\nbasis:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vert \\psi_+\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\vert 00\\rangle + \\vert 11\\rangle \\right), \\\\\n\\vert \\psi_-\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\vert 00\\rangle - \\vert 11\\rangle \\right), \\\\\n\\vert \\phi_+\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\vert 01\\rangle + \\vert 10\\rangle \\right), \\\\\n\\vert \\phi_-\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\vert 01\\rangle - \\vert 10\\rangle \\right).\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn our experiment, because $AB$ started in the $\\vert 00\\rangle$ state,\nwe create the $\\vert \\psi_+\\rangle$ Bell state as is shown in equation\n(1).\n"

Change of basis\n==================\n\n![](../demonstrations/teleportation/teleport_circuit_change_of_basis.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nThis is where things get tricky, but also very interesting. The third\nstep of the protocol is to apply a CNOT and a Hadamard to the first two\nqubits. This is done prior to the measurements, and labelled \\\"change of\nbasis\\\". But what basis is this? Notice how these two gates are the\n*opposite* of what we do to create a Bell state. If we run them in the\nopposite direction, we transform the basis back to the computational\none, and simulate a measurement in the Bell basis.\n\nAfter the basis transform, if we observe the first two qubits to be in\nthe state $\\vert 00\\rangle$, this would correspond to the outcome\n$\\vert \\psi_+\\rangle$ in the Bell basis, $\\vert 11\\rangle$ would\ncorrespond to $\\vert \\phi_-\\rangle$, etc. Let\\'s perform this change of\nbasis, one step at a time.\n\nSuppose we write our initial state $\\vert \\psi\\rangle$ as\n$\\alpha\\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1\\rangle$, with $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nbeing complex coefficients. Expanding out the terms from (1), we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\alpha\\vert 000\\rangle +\n\\beta\\vert 100\\rangle + \\alpha \\vert 011\\rangle +\n\\beta\\vert 111\\rangle )$$\n\nNow let\\'s apply a CNOT between Alice\\'s two qubits:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\alpha\\vert 000\\rangle +\n\\beta\\vert 110\\rangle + \\alpha \\vert 011\\rangle +\n\\beta\\vert 101\\rangle )$$\n\nAnd then a Hadamard on her first qubit:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} ( \\alpha \\vert 000\\rangle + \\alpha\\vert 100\\rangle + \\beta\\vert 010\\rangle - \\beta\\vert 110\\rangle + \\alpha \\vert 011\\rangle + \\alpha \\vert 111 \\rangle + \\beta\\vert 001\\rangle - \\beta\\vert 101 \\rangle ).$$\n\nNow we need to do some rearranging. We group the terms based on the\nfirst two qubits:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\vert 00\\rangle(\\alpha\\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1\\rangle) + \\frac{1}{2}\\vert 01\\rangle (\\beta\\vert 0\\rangle + \\alpha\\vert 1\\rangle) + \\frac{1}{2}\\vert 10\\rangle (\\alpha\\vert 0\\rangle - \\beta\\vert 1\\rangle) + \\frac{1}{2}\\vert 11\\rangle (-\\beta\\vert 0\\rangle + \\alpha\\vert 1\\rangle).\\tag{2}$$\n"

        "4. Measurement\n==============\n\n![](../demonstrations/teleportation/teleport_circuit_measurement.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"75.0%\"}\n\nThe last step of the protocol involves Alice performing a measurement on\nher qubits, and telling Bob to perform some operations depending on what\nshe measured. But why exactly do we need to do this? In the previous\nstep, we already performed a basis rotation back to the computational\nbasis, so shouldn\\'t we be good to go? Not quite, but almost!\n\nLet\\'s take another look at equation (2). If Alice measures her two\nqubits in the computational basis, she is equally likely to obtain any\nof the four possible outcomes. If she observes the first two qubits in\nthe state $\\vert 00 \\rangle$, she would immediately know that Bob\\'s\nqubit was in the state $\\alpha \\vert 0 \\rangle + \\beta \\vert 1 \\rangle$,\nwhich is precisely the state we are trying to teleport!\n\nIf instead she observed the qubits in state $\\vert 01\\rangle$, she\\'d\nstill know what state Bob has, but it\\'s a little off from the original\nstate. In particular, we have:\n\n$$\\beta \\vert 0 \\rangle + \\alpha \\vert 1 \\rangle = X \\vert \\psi \\rangle.$$\n\nAfter obtaining these results, Alice could tell Bob to simply apply an X\ngate to his qubit to recover the original state. Similarly, if she\nobtained $\\vert 10\\rangle$, she would tell him to apply a Z gate.\n\nIn the [\\\"traditional\\\" version of quantum\nteleportation](https://quantum.country/teleportation), this is, in fact,\nexactly what happens. Alice would call up Bob on the phone, tell him\nwhich state she observed, and then he would be able to apply an\nappropriate correction. In this situation, measurements are happening\npartway through the protocol, and the results would be used to control\nthe application of future quantum gates. This is known as mid-circuit\nmeasurement, and such mid-circuit measurements are expressed in\nPennyLane using `qml.measure <pennylane.measure>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"func\"}. Mid-circuit measurement results can be used to control\noperations, and this is expressed in PennyLane using\n`qml.cond <pennylane.cond>`{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"}.\n"

Let\\'s evaluate the action of the CNOT and CZ on\nBob\\'s qubit, and ensure that Alice\\'s state has been successfully\nteleported.
