One such device, [QuEra's\nAquila](https://www.quera.com/aquila), is capable of running circuits\nwith up to 256 physical qubits! The [Aquila\ndevice](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computers/quera/) is now\naccessible and programmable via pulse programming in PennyLane and the\n[PennyLane-Braket SDK\nplugin](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python).\nIn this demo, we will learn how to define a Hamiltonian for a driven\nRydberg atom system in PennyLane, and use it to first simulate a pulse\nprogram on Rydberg atoms, and then upload it and measure the effect of\nRydberg blockade on a hardware device!\n\n| \n\n![](../demonstrations/ahs_aquila/aquila_demo_image.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\n| \n\nPulse programming basics in PennyLane\n-------------------------------------\n\nPulse programming in PennyLane is a paradigm based on low-level control\nof electromagnetic driving pulses. Pulse programs are written directly\non the hardware level, skipping the abstraction of decomposing\nalgorithms into fixed native gate sets. While these abstractions are\noften used in proposed error correction schemes to achieve fault\ntolerance in a universal quantum computer, in noisy and\nintermediate-sized quantum computers, they can add unnecessary overhead\n(and thereby introduce more noise).\n\nIn quantum computing architectures where qubits are realized through\nphysical systems with discrete energy levels, transitions from one state\nto another are driven by electromagnetic fields tuned to be at or near\nthe relevant energy gap. These electromagnetic fields can vary as a\nfunction of time. The full system Hamiltonian is then a combination of\nthe Hamiltonian describing the state of the hardware when unperturbed,\nand a time-dependent drive.\n\nPulse control gives some insight into the low-level implementation of\nmore abstract quantum computations. In most digital quantum\narchitectures, the native gates of the computer are, at the\nimplementation level, electromagnetic control pulses that have been\nfinely tuned to perform a particular logical gate.\n\nThis alternative approach requires a different type of control than what\nyou might be used to in PennyLane, where circuits are generally defined\nin terms of a series of gates. Specifically, pulse control is\nimplemented via the functionality provided in the Pennylane\n`~pennylane.pulse`{.interpreted-text role=\"mod\"} module. For more\ninformation on pulse programming in PennyLane, see the [PennyLane\ndocs](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_pulse.html), or check\nout the demo about [running a ctrl-VQE algorithm with pulse\ncontrol](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_pulse_programming101.html)\non the PennyLane [default.qubit]{.title-ref} simulator.\n\nThe QuEra Aquila device\n-----------------------\n\nThe Aquila QPU works with programmable arrays of up to 256 Rubidium-87\natoms (Rb-87), trapped in vacuum by tightly focused laser beams. These\natoms can be arranged in (almost) [arbitrary user-specified\ngeometries](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_pasqal.html) to\ndetermine inter-qubit interactions. On the Aquila device, it is possible\nto specify 1D and 2D atom arrangements. Atom positions may be slightly\nshifted to accommodate hardware limitations, and must obey lattice\nconstraints for spacing. This will be explored in more detail below.\n\nDifferent energy levels of these atoms are used to encode qubits.\n\nA primary application of pulse control in Rydberg atom systems like\nAquila is the implementation of analog Hamiltonian simulation. This is a\ntechnique that aims to investigate the behaviour of some system of\ninterest using a programmable, controllable device that emulates the\ntarget system. For example, Rydberg atom systems have been used to probe\nthe behaviour of quantum spin liquids and antiferromagnetic Ising\nmodels.\n\nConstructing a pulse program to run on the Aquila hardware is done in\ntwo steps, each of which allows us to modify different parts of the\nsystem Hamiltonian:\n\n1.  Define atom positions, which determines qubit connectivity\n2.  Specify the quantum evolution via the drive parameters\n\nLet\\'s start with the atom positions and the resulting Hamiltonian term\ndescribing inter-qubit interactions.\n\n### Interaction term and atom arrangement\n\nIn this treatment of the Hamiltonian, we will assume that we are\noperating such that we only allow access to two states; the low and high\nenergy states are referred to as the ground ($\\ket{g}$) and Rydberg\n($\\ket{r}$) states respectively.\n\nQubit interaction in a Rydberg atom system is mediated by a mechanism\ncalled Rydberg blockade, which arises due to van der Waals forces\nbetween the atoms. This is described by the interaction Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\\hat{H}_{int} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\\sum_{k=j+1}^{N} \\frac{C_6}{R^6_{jk}}\\hat{n}_j\\hat{n}_k$$\n\nwhere $n_j=\\ket{r_j}\\bra{r_j}$ is the number operator acting on atom\n$j$, $R_{jk} = \\lvert x_j - x_k \\lvert$ is the distance between atoms\n$j$ and $k$, and $C_6$ is a fixed value determined by the nature of the\nground and Rydberg states (for Aquila,\n$5.24 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{rad m}^6 / \\text{s}$, referring to the\n$| 70S_{1/2} \\rangle$ state of the Rb-87 atom).\n\nThere are two key things to be aware of in the interaction term. First,\nthe energy contribution of the interaction between each pair of atoms is\nonly non-zero when both atoms are in the Rydberg state, so that\n$\\bra{\\psi}\\hat{n}_k \\hat{n}_j\\ket{\\psi}=1$. Second, the energy\ncontribution for each pair of atoms is inversely proportional to the\ndistance between them. Thus, as we move two atoms closer together, it\nbecomes increasingly energetically expensive for both to be in the\nRydberg state.\n\nIn the Aquila system, to modify these interactions, we define a\n*register* (the layout of the atoms).\n\nBelow is a conceptual diagram demonstrating this interaction for a pair\nof atoms. At a distance, a similar energetic cost is paid to from 0 to 1\nexcitation and from 1 to 2 excitations. However, as we move the atoms\ninto closer proximity, we see a rapidly increasing energy cost to drive\nto the doubly excited state.\n\n![Energy levels for the ground ($\\ket{gg}$), single Rydberg excitation\n($\\ket{gr}$, $\\ket{rg}$), and double Rydberg excitation ($\\ket{rr}$)\nstates](../demonstrations/ahs_aquila/rydberg_blockade_diagram.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"95.0%\"}\n\nThe modification of the energy levels when atoms are in proximity gives\nrise to Rydberg blockade, where atoms that have been driven by a pulse\nthat would, in isolation, leave them in the excited state instead remain\nin the ground state due to neighboring atoms being excited.\n\nThis brings us to our discussion of the second part of the Hamiltonian:\nthe drive term.\n\n### The driven Rydberg Hamiltonian\n\nThe atoms in a Rydberg system can be driven by application of a laser\npulse, which can be described by 3 parameters: amplitude (also called\nRabi frequency) $\\Omega$, detuning $\\Delta$, and phase $\\phi$. While in\ntheory, a drive pulse can be applied to individual atoms, the current\ncontrol setup for the Aquila hardware only allows the application of a\nglobal drive pulse.\n\nLet's look at how this plays out in the Hamiltonian describing a global\ndrive targeting the ground to Rydberg state transition. The driven\nHamiltonian of the system is:\n\n$$\\hat{H}_{drive} = \\sum_{k=1}^N \\frac{\\Omega(t)}{2} (e^{i \\phi(t)}\\ket{g_k}\\bra{r_k} + e^{-i \\phi(t)} \\ket{r_k}\\bra{g_k}) - \\Delta(t) \\hat{n}_k$$\n\nwhere $\\ket{r}$ and $\\ket{g}$ are the Rydberg and ground states.\n\nNow that we know a bit about the system we will be manipulating, let us\nlook at how to connect to a real device.\n\nGetting started with Amazon Braket\n----------------------------------\n\nFor this demo, we will integrate PennyLane with Amazon Braket to perform\nmeasurements on Rydberg atom based hardware provided by QuEra.\n\nIn PennyLane, Amazon Braket is accessed through the PennyLane-Braket\nplugin. The installation instructions for the plugin can be found\n[here](https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\n\nThe Pennylane-Braket plugin also comes pre-installed in the Braket\nmanaged notebooks accessible through the [AWS\nconsole](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/).\n\nThe remote hardware devices available on Amazon Braket can be found\n[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html),\nalong with information about each system, including which paradigm\n(gate-based, continuous variable or analog Hamiltonian simulation) it\noperates under. Each device has a unique identifier known as an ARN. In\nPennyLane, AHS-based Braket devices are accessed through a PennyLane\ndevice named `braket.aws.ahs`, along with specification of the\ncorresponding ARN.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nTo access remote services on Amazon Braket, you must first [create an\naccount on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/getting-started/) and also\nfollow the [setup\ninstructions](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python) for\naccessing Braket from Python.\n:::\n\n### Connecting to Aquila\n\nOnce you are set up with a Braket account, you can access the Aquila\ndevice. It is available online in particular time windows, which can be\nfound [here](https://www.quera.com/aquila) , though you can submit tasks\nto the queue at any time. Note that depending on queue lengths, there\ncan be some wait time to receive results even during the availability\nwindow of the device.\n\nA simulated version on the Aquila hardware, `braket.local.ahs`, is also\navailable, and is an excellent resource for testing out programs before\ncommitting to a particular hardware task. It is important to be aware\nthat some tasks that succeed in simulation will not be able to be sent\nto hardware due to physical constraints of the measurement and control\nsetup. Also, be aware of the hardware specifications and capabilities\nwhen planning your pulse program. These capabilities are accessible at\nany time from the hardware device; we will demonstrate in more detail\nhow to access these specifications as we go through this demo.\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nThose cells of this demo that contain the real device `aquila` will only\nrun when hardware is online. If you want to run it at other times to\nexperiment with the concepts, the hardware device can be switched out\nwith the Braket AHS simulator. When interpreting the section of the demo\nregarding discretization for hardware, bear in mind that the simulator\ndoes not discretize the functions before upload, so it will not\naccurately demonstrate the discretization behaviour.\n:::\n\nLet us access both the remote hardware device, and a local Rydberg atom\nsimulator from AWS, and then we can start defining our pulse program.\n"

It is now possible to connect to the Aquila QPU via\nPennyLane and Amazon Braket, and perform measurements on hardware with\nup to 256 qubits. Programs for the Aquila hardware can be defined using\nPennyLane\\'s `~pennylane.pulse`{.interpreted-text role=\"mod\"} module,\nallowing users to define time-dependent control of pulse parameters.\n\nInterfacing with the Aquila hardware provides an opportunity to take a\nsmall model of a concept that has been tested in simulation, and scale\nup to run on up to 256 qubits on hardware. Manipulating Rydberg atom\nsystems through pulse-level control has applications in probing new\nareas of fundamental physics---like simulating quantum spin liquids at\nscales where it is not possible to classically simulate the quantum\ndynamics of the full experimental system![^1][^2]\n\nHere we have demonstrated a simple, amplitude-only pulse implementing\nthe quintessential behaviour of Rydberg atom systems: Rydberg blockade.\nIntroducing phase and detuning to create a more complex drive\nHamiltonian, and arranging atoms to create specific configurations of\ninter-atom interaction, allows more intricate systems to be studied.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n[^1]: G.
