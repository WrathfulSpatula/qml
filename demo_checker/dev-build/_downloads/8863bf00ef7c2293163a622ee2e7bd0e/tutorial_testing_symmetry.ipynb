        "Testing for symmetry with quantum computers\n===========================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Test if a system possesses discrete\nsymmetries :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/thumbnail_tutorial_testing_symmetry.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_geometric\\_qml Intro to geometric quantum machine learning\n:::\n\n*Author: David Wakeham. Posted: 24 January 2023.*\n\nSymmetries are transformations that leave something looking the same.\nThey are not only pretty --- think of geometric patterns and shapes ---\nbut a great labour-saving device for the lazy physicist! You can do\nsomething once, and by applying transformations, find your work has been\nmultiplied ten-fold. Symmetries need not be exact, since a system can\nlook approximately, rather than exactly, the same after a\ntransformation. It therefore makes sense to have an algorithm to\ndetermine if a Hamiltonian, encoding the physics of a quantum system,\nhas an approximate symmetry.\n\n![](../demonstrations/testing_symmetry/symm2.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"40.0%\"}\n\nIn this demo, we'll implement the elegant algorithm of [LaBorde and\nWilde (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10017.pdf) for testing the\nsymmetries of a Hamiltonian. We'll be able to determine whether a system\nhas a finite group of symmetries $G$, and if not, by how much the\nsymmetry is violated.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nWe will encode symmetries into a [finite\ngroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group). This is an algebraic\nstructure consisting of transformations $g$, which act on the Hilbert\nspace $\\mathcal{H}$ of our system in the form of unitary operators\n$U(g)$ for $g \\in G$. More formally, given any two elements\n$g_1, g_2\\in G$, there is a *product* $g_1 \\circ g_2 \\in G$, and such\nthat:\n\n-   **multiplication is associative**,\n    $g_1 \\circ (g_2 \\circ g_3) = (g_1 \\circ g_2) \\circ g_3$ for all\n    $g_1, g_2, g_3 \\in G$;\n-   **there is a boring transformation** $e$ that does nothing,\n    $g \\circ e = e \\circ g = e$ for all $g \\in G$;\n-   **transformations can be undone**, with some $g^{-1} \\in G$ such\n    that $g \\circ g^{-1} = g^{-1} \\circ g = e$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\nIt is sensible to ask that the unitary operators preserve the structure\nof the group:\n\n$$U(g_1)U(g_2) = U(g_1 \\circ g_2).$$\n\nFor more on groups and how to represent them with matrices, see our\n[demo on geometric\nlearning](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_geometric_qml.html).\nFor the Hamiltonian to respect the symmetries encoded in the group $G$\nit means that it commutes with the matrices,\n\n$$[U(g),\\hat{H}] = 0$$\n\nfor all $g \\in G$. Since the Hamiltonian generates time evolution, this\nmeans that if we apply a group transformation now or we apply it later,\nthe effect is the same. Thus, we seek an algorithm which checks if these\ncommutators are zero.\n\nAveraging over symmetries\n-------------------------\n\nTo verify that the Hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to $G$, it\nseems like we will need to check each element $g \\in G$ separately.\nThere is a clever way to avoid this and boil it all down to a single\nnumber. For now, we'll content ourselves with looking at the *average*\nover the group:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}[U(g),\\hat{H}] = 0.$$\n\nTo make things concrete, let's consider the [cyclic\ngroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group) $G = \\mathbb{Z}_4$,\nwhich we can think of as rotations of the square. If we place a qubit on\neach corner, this group will naturally act on four qubits.\n\n![](../demonstrations/testing_symmetry/square.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"30.0%\"}\n\nIt is generated by a single rotation, which we'll call $c$. We'll\nconsider three Hamiltonians: one which is exactly symmetric with respect\nto $G$ (called $\\hat{H}_\\text{symm}$), one which is near symmetric\n(called $\\hat{H}_\\text{nsym}$), and one which is asymmetric (called\n$\\hat{H}_\\text{asym}$). We\\'ll define them by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{H}_\\text{symm} & = X_0 + X_1 + X_2 + X_3\\\\\n\\hat{H}_\\text{nsym} & = X_0 + 1.1 \\cdot X_1 + 0.9 \\cdot X_2 + X_3 \\\\\n\\hat{H}_\\text{asym} & = X_0 + 2\\cdot X_1 + 3\\cdot X_2.\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nLet's see how this looks in PennyLane. We'll create a register `system`\nwith four wires, one for each qubit. The generator $c$ acts as a\npermutation:\n\n$$\\vert x_0 x_1 x_2 x_3\\rangle \\overset{c}{\\mapsto} \\vert x_3 x_0 x_1 x_2\\rangle$$\n\nfor basis states $\\vert x_0 x_1 x_2 x_3\\rangle$ and extends by\nlinearity. The simplest way to do this is by using\n`qml.Permute <pennylane.Permute>`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}. We\ncan convert this into a matrix by using\n`qml.matrix() <pennylane.matrix>`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}. We\ncan obtain any other element $g\\in G$ by simply iterating $c$ the\nappropriate number of times.\n"

        "To arrive at the algorithm for testing this average symmetry property,\nwe start with a trick called the [Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski\nisomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi%E2%80%93Jamio%C5%82kowski_isomorphism)\nfor thinking of time evolution as a state instead of an operator. This\nstate is called the *dual* of the operator. It's easy to describe how to\nconstruct this state in words: make a copy $\\mathcal{H}_\\text{copy}$ of\nthe system $\\mathcal{H}$, create a maximally entangled state, and time\nevolve the state on $\\mathcal{H}$. In fact, this trick works to give a\ndual state $\\vert\\Phi^U\\rangle$ for any operator $U$, as below:\n\n![](../demonstrations/testing_symmetry/choi.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"40.0%\"}\n\nWe\\'ve pictured entanglement by joining the wires corresponding to the\nsystem and the copy. For time evolution, we'll call the dual state\n$\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle$, and formally define it:\n\n$$\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=1}^d e^{-it\\hat{H}}\\vert i\\rangle \\otimes \\vert i_\\text{copy}\\rangle.$$\n\nYou can [show mathematically](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10017.pdf) that\nthe average symmetry condition is equivalent to\n\n$$\\Pi_G\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle = \\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle,$$\n\nwhere $\\Pi_G$ is an operator defined by\n\n$$\\Pi_G  = \\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G} U(g) \\otimes \\overline{U(g)}.$$\n\nIn fact, it turns out that $\\Pi_G^2 = \\Pi_G$, and hence it is a\n*projector*, with an associated measurement, asking: is the state\nsymmetric on average? The statement\n$\\Pi_G \\vert \\Psi_t\\rangle = \\vert \\Psi_t \\rangle$ is a mathematical way\nof saying \"yes\". So, our goal now is to write a circuit which (a)\nprepares the state $\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle$, and (b) performs the\nmeasurement $\\Pi_G$. Part (a) is simpler --- in general, we can just use\na \"cascade\" of Hadamards and CNOTs, similar to the usual circuit for\ngenerating a Bell state on two qubits, as pictured below:\n\n![](../demonstrations/testing_symmetry/bells.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nLet's implement this for our four-qubit system in PennyLane:\n"

        "Controlled symmetries\n=====================\n\nPart (b) is more interesting. The simplest approach is to use an\nauxiliary register $\\mathcal{H}_G$ which encodes $G$, with basis\nelements $\\vert g\\rangle$ labelled by group elements $g \\in G$. This\nneeds $\\log \\vert G\\vert$ qubits, which (along with any Hamiltonian\nsimulation) will form the main resource cost of the algorithm. These\nwill then can group transformations to a state\n$\\vert\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}\\otimes \\mathcal{H}_\\text{copy}$ in a\ncontrolled way via\n\n$$\\vert{\\psi}\\rangle \\otimes \\vert g\\rangle \\mapsto (U(g)\\otimes \\overline{U(g)})\\vert{\\psi} \\rangle \\otimes \\vert g\\rangle_G,$$\n\nwhich we'll call $CU$. We take this controlled gate as a primitive. To\ntest average symmetry, we simply place $\\mathcal{H}_G$ in a uniform\nsuperposition\n\n$$\\vert +\\rangle_G = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|G|}}\\sum_{g\\in G} \\vert g\\rangle_G$$\n\nand apply the controlled operator to the state generated in part (a).\nThis gives\n\n$$\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle \\otimes \\vert +\\rangle_G \\mapsto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|G|}}\\sum_{g\\in G}(U(g)\\otimes \\overline{U(g)})\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle \\otimes \\vert g\\rangle_G.$$\n\nThis isn't quite what we want yet, in particular because the system\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is entangled not only with the copy, but also with the\nregister $\\mathcal{H}_G$. To fix this, we observe the *register*, and\nsee if it's in the superposition $\\vert+\\rangle_G$. The state,\nconditioned on this observation, is\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{align*}\n{}_G\\langle +\\vert \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|G|}}\\sum_{g\\in G}(U(g)\\otimes \\overline{U(g)})\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle \\otimes \\vert g\\rangle_G & = \\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g, g'\\in G}(U(g)\\otimes \\overline{U(g)})\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle \\langle g'\\vert g\\rangle_G \\\\ & = \\Pi_G \\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle,\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nand hence the probability of observing it is\n\n$$P_+ = \\vert \\Pi_G \\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle \\vert^2 = \\langle \\Phi_t \\vert \\Pi_G^\\dagger \\Pi_G\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_t \\vert \\Pi_G\\vert\\Phi_t\\rangle$$\n\nThis is exactly what we want! So, let's code all this up for our\nexample. We'll need two qubits for our auxiliary register\n$\\mathcal{H}_G$. To place it in a uniform superposition, just apply a\nHadamard gate to each qubit. To measure the $\\vert+\\rangle_G$ state at\nthe end, we undo these Hadamards and try to measure \"$00$\". Finally,\nit's straightforward to implement the controlled gate $CU$ using\ncontrolled operations (namely\n`qml.ControlledQubitUnitary<pennylane.ControlledQubitUnitary>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"}) on each qubit:\n\n![](../demonstrations/testing_symmetry/cu.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n"

Second, even if we could do that, we don't know what the\nnumbers coming out of the circuit mean. We can address both questions by\nconsidering very short times, $t \\to 0$. In this case, we can Taylor\nexpand the unitary time-evolution operator,\n\n$$e^{-it \\hat{H}} = \\mathbb{I} - it \\hat{H} - \\frac{t^2 \\hat{H}^2}{2} + O(t^3).$$\n\nWe'll assume that, if we're simulating the evolution, the expansion is\naccurate to this order.
