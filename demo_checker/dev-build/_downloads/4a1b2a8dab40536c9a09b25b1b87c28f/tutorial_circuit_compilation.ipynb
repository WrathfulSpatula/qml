        "Compilation of quantum circuits\n===============================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Learn about circuit transformations and\nquantum circuit compilation with PennyLane :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/thumbnail_tutorial_circuit_compilation.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_quantum\\_circuit\\_cutting Introduction to circuit cutting\n:::\n\n*Author: Borja Requena --- Posted: 14 June 2023.*\n\nQuantum circuits take many different forms from the moment we design\nthem to the point where they are ready to run on a quantum device. These\nchanges happen during the compilation process of the quantum circuits,\nwhich relies on the fact that there are many equivalent representations\nof quantum circuits that use different sets of gates but provide the\nsame output.\n\nOut of those representations, we are typically interested in finding the\nmost suitable one for our purposes. For example, we usually look for the\none that will incur the least amount of errors in the specific hardware\non which we are compiling the circuit. This usually implies decomposing\nthe quantum gates in terms of the native ones of the quantum device,\nadapting the operations to the hardrware\\'s topology, combining them to\nreduce the circuit depth, etc.\n\nA crucial part of the compilation process consists of repeatedly\nperforming minor circuit modifications. In PennyLane, we can apply\n`~pennylane.transforms`{.interpreted-text role=\"mod\"} to our quantum\nfunctions in order to obtain equivalent ones that may be more convenient\nfor our task. In this tutorial, we introduce the most fundamental\ntransforms involved in the compilation of quantum circuits.\n\nCircuit transforms\n------------------\n\nWhen we implement quantum algorithms, it is typically in our best\ninterest that the resulting circuits are as shallow as possible,\nespecially with the currently available noisy quantum devices. However,\nthey are often more complex than needed, containing multiple operations\nthat could be combined to reduce the circuit complexity, although it is\nnot always obvious. Here, we introduce three simple\n`~pennylane.transforms`{.interpreted-text role=\"mod\"} that can be\nimplemented together to obtain simpler quantum circuits. The transforms\nare based on very basic circuit equivalences:\n\n![](../demonstrations/circuit_compilation/circuit_transforms.jpg){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nTo illustrate their combined effect, let us consider the following\ncircuit.\n"
