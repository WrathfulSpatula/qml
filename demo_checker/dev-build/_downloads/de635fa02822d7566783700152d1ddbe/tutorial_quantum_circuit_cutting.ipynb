Last updated: 02 September 2022.*\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nQuantum circuits with a large number of qubits are difficult to\nsimulate. They cannot be programmed on actual hardware due to size\nconstraints (insufficient qubits), and they are also error-prone. What\nif we \\\"cut\\\" a large circuit into smaller, more manageable pieces? This\nis the main idea behind the algorithm that allows you to simulate large\nquantum circuits on a small quantum computer called *quantum circuit\ncutting*.\n\nIn this demo, we will first introduce the theory behind quantum circuit\ncutting based on Pauli measurements and see how it is implemented in\nPennyLane. This method was first introduced in. Thereafter, we discuss\nthe theoretical basis on randomized circuit cutting with two-designs and\ndemonstrate the resulting improvement in performance compared to Pauli\nmeasurement-based circuit cutting for an instance of Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA).\n\nBackground: Understanding the Pauli cutting method\n==================================================\n\nConsider a two-level quantum system in an arbitrary state, described by\ndensity matrix $\\rho$. The quantum state $\\rho$ can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of the Pauli matrices:\n\n$$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{8} c_i Tr(\\rho O_i)\\rho_i.$$\n\nHere, we have denoted Pauli matrices by $O_i$, their eigenprojectors by\n$\\rho_i$ and their corresponding eigenvalues by $c_i$. In the above\nequation,\n\n$$O_1 = O_2 = I,$$\n\n$$O_3 = O_4 = X,$$\n\n$$O_5 = O_6 = Y$$\n\nand\n\n$$O_7 = O_8 = Z.$$\n\nAlso,\n\n$$\\rho_1 = \\rho_7=\\left | {0} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {0} \\right |,$$\n\n$$\\rho_2 = \\rho_8 = \\left | {1} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {1} \\right |,$$\n\n$$\\rho_3 = \\left | {+} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {+} \\right |,$$\n\n$$\\rho_4 = \\left | {-} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {-} \\right |,$$\n\n$$\\rho_5 = \\left | {+i} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {+i} \\right |,$$\n\n$$\\rho_6 = \\left | {-i} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {-i} \\right |$$\n\nand\n\n$$c_i = \\pm 1.$$\n\nThe above equation can be implemented as a quantum circuit on a quantum\ncomputer. To do this, each term $Tr(\\rho O_i)\\rho_i$ in the equation is\nbroken into two parts. The first part, $Tr(\\rho O_i)$ is the expectation\nof the observable $O_i$ when the system is in the state $\\rho$. Let\\'s\ncall this first circuit subcircuit-$u$. The second part, $\\rho_i$ is\ninitialization or preparation of the eigenstate, $\\rho_i$. Let\\'s call\nthis Second circuit subcircuit-$v$. The above equation shows how we can\nrecover a quantum state after a cut is made on one of its qubits as\nshown in figure 1. This forms the core of quantum circuit cutting.\n\nIt turns out that we only have to do three measurements\n$\\left (Tr(\\rho X), Tr(\\rho Y), Tr(\\rho Z) \\right)$ for subcircuit-$u$\nand initialize subcircuit-$v$ with only four states:\n$\\left | {0} \\right\\rangle$, $\\left | {1} \\right\\rangle$,\n$\\left | {+} \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left | {+i} \\right\\rangle$. The other\ntwo nontrivial expectation values for states $\\left | {-} \\right\\rangle$\nand $\\left | {- i} \\right\\rangle$ can be derived with classical\npost-processing.\n\nIn general, there is a resolution of the identity along a wire (qubit)\nthat we can interpret as circuit cutting. In the following section, we\nwill provide a more clever way of resolving the same identity that leads\nto fewer shots needed to estimate observables.\n\n![Figure 1. The Pauli circuit cutting method for 1-qubit circuit. The\nfirst half of the cut circuit on the left (subcircuit-u) is the part\nwith `MeasureNode`. The second half of the cut circuit on the right\n(subcircuit-v) is the part with\n`PrepareNode`](../demonstrations/quantum_circuit_cutting/1Qubit-Circuit-Cutting.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"80.0%\"}\n\nPennyLane implementation\n------------------------\n\nPennyLane\\'s built-in circuit cutting algorithm, `qml.cut_circuit`,\ntakes a large quantum circuit and decomposes it into smaller subcircuits\nthat are executed on a small quantum device. The results from executing\nthe smaller subcircuits are then recombined through some classical\npost-processing to obtain the original result of the large quantum\ncircuit.\n\nLet's simulate a \\\"real-world\\\" scenario with `qml.cut_circuit` using\nthe circuit below.\n"

        "Randomized Circuit Cutting\n==========================\n\nAfter reviewing the standard circuit cutting based on Pauli measurements\non single qubits, we are now ready to discuss an improved circuit\ncutting protocol that uses randomized measurements to speed up circuit\ncutting. Our description of this method will be based on the recently\npublished work.\n\nThe key idea behind this approach is to use measurements in an entangled\nbasis that is based on a unitary 2-design to get more information about\nthe state with fewer measurements compared to single-qubit Pauli\nmeasurements.\n\nThe concept of 2-designs is simple --- a unitary 2-design is a finite\ncollection of unitaries such that the average of any degree 2 polynomial\nfunction of a linear operator over the design is exactly the same as the\naverage over Haar random measure. For further explanation of this\nmeasure read the [Haar Measure\ndemo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_haar_measure.html).\n\nMore precisely, let $P(U)$ be a polynomial with homogeneous degree at\nmost two in the entries of a unitary matrix $U$, and degree two in the\ncomplex conjugates of those entries. A unitary 2-design is a set of $L$\nunitaries $\\{U_{L}\\}$ such that\n\n$$\\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{l=1}^{L} P(U_l) = \\int_{\\mathcal{U}(d)} P (U) d\\mu(U)~.$$\n\nThe elements of the Clifford group over the qubits being cut are an\nexample of a 2-design. We don't have a lot of space here to go into too\nmany details. But fear not - there is an [entire\ndemo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_unitary_designs.html)\ndedicated to this wonderful topic!\n\n![Figure 4. Illustration of Randomized Circuit Cutting based on\nTwo-Designs. Taken\nfrom.](../demonstrations/quantum_circuit_cutting/flowchart.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nIf $k$ qubits are being cut, then the dimensionality of the Hilbert\nspace is $d=2^{k}$. The key idea of Randomized Circuit Cutting is to\nemploy two different quantum channels with probabilities such that\ntogether they comprise a resolution of Identity. In the randomized\nmeasurement circuit cutting procedure, we trace out the $k$ qubits and\nprepare a random basis state with probability $d/(2d+1)$. For a linear\noperator $X \\in \\mathbf{L}(\\mathbb{C}^{d})$ acting on the $k$ qubits,\nthis operation corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel\n\n$$\\Psi_{1}(X) = \\textrm{Tr}(X)\\frac{\\mathbf{1}}{d}~.$$\n\nOtherwise, we perform a measure-and-prepare protocol based on a unitary\n2-design (e.g.\u00a0a random Clifford) with probability $(d+1)/(2d+1)$,\ncorresponding to the channel\n\n$$\\Psi_{0}(X) = \\frac{1}{d+1}\\left(\\textrm{Tr}(X)\\mathbf{1} + X\\right)~.$$\n\nThe sets of Kraus operators for the channels $\\Psi_{1} and \\Psi_{0}$ are\n\n$$\\Psi_{1}(X) \\xrightarrow{} \\left\\{ \\frac{|i\\rangle \\langle j|}{\\sqrt{d}} \\right\\} \\quad\n\\Psi_{0}(X) \\xrightarrow{} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathbf{1}}{\\sqrt{d+1}} ~,~ \\frac{|i\\rangle \\langle j|}{\\sqrt{d+1}} \\right\\}~,$$\n\nwhere indices $i,j$ run over the $d$ basis elements.\n\nTogether, these two channels can be used to obtain a resolution of the\nIdentity channel on the $k$-qubits as follows\n\n$$X = (d+1)\\Psi_0(X)-d\\Psi_1(X)~.$$\n\nBy employing this procedure, we can estimate the outcome of the original\ncircuit by using the cut circuits. For an error threshold of\n$\\varepsilon$, the associated overhead is\n$O(4^{k}(n+k^{2})/\\varepsilon^{2})$. When $k$ is a small constant and\nthe circuit is cut into roughly two equal halves, this procedure\neffectively doubles the number of qubits that can be simulated given a\nquantum device, since the overhead is $O(4^k)$ which is much lower than\nthe $O(16^k)$ overhead of cutting with single-qubit measurements. Note\nthat, although the overhead incurred is smaller, the average depth of\nthe circuit is greater since a random Clifford unitary over the $k$\nqubits has to be implemented when randomized measurement is performed.\n\nComparison\n==========\n\nWe have seen that looking at circuit cutting through the lens of\n2-designs can be a source of considerable speedups. A good test case\nwhere one may care about accurately estimating an observable is the\n[Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html)\n(QAOA). In its simplest form, QAOA concerns itself with finding a lowest\nenergy state of a *cost Hamiltonian* $H_{\\mathcal{C}}$:\n\n$$H_\\mathcal{C} = \\frac{1}{|E|} \\sum _{(i, j) \\in E} Z_i Z_j$$\n\non a graph $G=(V,E)$, where $Z_i$ is a Pauli-$Z$ operator. The\nnormalization factor is just here so that expectation values do not lie\noutside the $[-1,1]$ interval.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nSuppose that we have a specific class of graphs we care about and\nsomeone already provided us with optimal angles $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ for\nQAOA of depth $p=1$. Here's how to map the input graph $G$ to the QAOA\ncircuit that solves our problem:\n\n![Figure 5. An example of mapping an input interaction graph to a QAOA\ncircuit. (Note: the \"stick\" gates represent the ZZ rotation gates, to\navoid overcrowding the\ndiagram.)](../demonstrations/quantum_circuit_cutting/graph_to_circuit.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nLet's generate a similar QAOA graph to the one in the figure this using\n[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)!\n"

An example of QAOA cost convergence for a circuit cut both\nwith the Pauli method and randomized channel\nmethod.](../demonstrations/quantum_circuit_cutting/shots_vs_cost_p2.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nThe randomized method offers a quadratic overhead reduction. In\npractice, for larger cuts, we see that it offers a performance that is\norders of magnitude better than that of the Pauli method. For larger\ncircuits, even at $10^6$ shots, Pauli estimates still sometimes leave\nthe allowed interval of $[-1,1]$.\n\nHowever, these improvements come at the cost of increased circuit depth\ndue to inserting random Clifford gates and additional classical\ncommunication required.\n\nMultiple cuts and mid-circuit measurements\n==========================================\n\nCareful readers may have noticed that QAOA at depth $p=1$ has a specific\nstructure of a [Matrix Product\nState](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_tn_circuits.html) (MPS)\ncircuit. However, in order to cut a $p=2$ QAOA circuit, we would need 2\ncuts. This introduces some subtleties within the context of classical\nsimulation that we point out here.\n\nThe measurement performed as a part of the first cut always induces a\nreduced state on the remaining wires. If the circuit has an MPS\nstructure, we can just measure all qubits at once ---a part of the\nmeasured bitstring gets passed into the second fragment and the\nremaining bits go directly into the output bitstring. However, when we\ntry the same thing on a non-MPS circuit, additional gates need to be\napplied on the wires that now hold a reduced state. This is the other\nreason why it is easier to simulate circuit cutting of a non-MPS circuit\nwith a mixed-state simulator.\n\n![Figure 7. A schematic representation of the mid-circuit measurement\n\"problem\".](../demonstrations/quantum_circuit_cutting/mid_circuit_measure.svg){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nNote that, in these cases, memory requirements of classical simulation\nare increased from $O(2^n)$ to $O(4^n)$. However, this is only a\nconstraint for classical simulation where we have to choose between\nstate-vector and density-matrix approaches. Real quantum devices don't\nhave such limitations, of course.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nAbout the authors\n-----------------\n"
