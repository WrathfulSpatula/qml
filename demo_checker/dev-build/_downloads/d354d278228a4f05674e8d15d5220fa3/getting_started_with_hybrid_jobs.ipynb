        "Getting started with Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs\n=======================================\n\nThis tutorial provides an introduction to running hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms using PennyLane on [Amazon\nBraket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/). With Amazon Braket, you gain\naccess to both real quantum devices and scalable classical compute,\nenabling you to push the boundaries of your algorithm.\n\nIn this tutorial, we\\'ll walk through how to create your first hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms on AWS. With a single-line-of-code, we\\'ll\nsee how to scale from PennyLane simulators on your laptop to running\nfull-scale experiments on AWS that leverage both powerful classical\ncompute and quantum devices. You\\'ll gain understanding of the hybrid\njobs queue, including QPU priority queuing, and learn how to scale\nclassical resources for resource-intensive tasks. We hope these tools\nwill empower you to start experimenting today with hybrid quantum\nalgorithms!\n\n![](/demonstrations/getting_started_with_hybrid_jobs/socialthumbnail_large_getting_started_with_hybrid_jobs.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"65.0%\"}\n\nAmazon Braket Hybrid Jobs\n=========================\n\nAmazon Braket Hybrid Jobs offers a way for you to run hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms that require both classical resources and\nquantum processing units (QPUs). Hybrid Jobs is designed to spin up the\nrequested classical compute, run your algorithm, and release the\ninstances after completion so you only pay for what you use. This\nworkflow is ideal for long-running iterative algorithms involving both\nclassical and quantum resources. Simply package up your code into a\nsingle function, create a hybrid job with a single line of code, and\nBraket will schedule it to run as soon as possible without interruption.\n\nHybrid jobs have a separate queue from quantum tasks, so once your\nalgorithm starts running, it will not be interrupted by variations in\nthe quantum task queue. This helps your long-running algorithms run\nefficiently and predictably. Any quantum tasks created from a running\nhybrid job will be run before any other quantum tasks in the queue. This\nis particularly beneficial for iterative hybrid algorithms where\nsubsequent tasks depend on the outcomes of prior quantum tasks. Examples\nof such algorithms include the Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA), Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), or Quantum\nMachine Learning (QML). You can also monitor your algorithm\\'s progress\nin near-real time, enabling you to keep track of costs, budget, or\ncustom metrics such as training loss or expectation values.\n\nImportantly, on specific QPUs, running your algorithm in Hybrid Jobs\nbenefits from [parametric\ncompilation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-parametric-compilation.html).\nThis reduces the overhead associated with the computationally expensive\ncompilation step by compiling a circuit only once and not for every\niteration in your hybrid algorithm. This dramatically reduces the total\nruntime for many variational algorithms. For long-running hybrid jobs,\nBraket automatically uses the updated calibration data from the hardware\nprovider when compiling your circuit to ensure the highest quality\nresults.\n\nGetting started with PennyLane\n==============================\n\nLet's setup an algorithm that makes use of both classical and quantum\nresources. We adapt the\n`PennyLane qubit rotation tutorial<tutorial_qubit_rotation>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}.\n\n::: {.warning}\n::: {.title}\nWarning\n:::\n\nThe following demo is only compatible with Python version 3.10.\n:::\n"

        "Running as a hybrid job\n=======================\n\nTo run our algorithm for a long time, we can run it asynchronously with\nAmazon Braket Hybrid Jobs, which fully manages the classical\ninfrastructure so you can focus on the algorithm. For example, you can\ntrain a larger circuit, or increase the number of iterations. Note that\neach hybrid job has at least a one minute startup time since it creates\na containerized environment on Amazon EC2. So for very short workloads,\nsuch as a single circuit or a batch of circuits, it may suffice for you\nto use quantum tasks.\n\nWe now show how you can go from running your local Python function to\nrunning it as a hybrid job. Note that only Python 3.10 is supported by\ndefault. For custom environments, you can opt to hybrid job scripts, or\na custom container from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) (see\n[containers\ndocumentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-byoc.html)).\n\nThe first step to creating a hybrid job is to annotate which function\nyou want to run with the `@hybrid_job` decorator. Then you create the\njob by invoking the function as you would for normal Python functions.\nHowever, the decorated function returns the hybrid job handle rather\nthan the result of the function. To retrieve the results after it has\nbeen completed, use `job.result()`.\n\nThe required device argument in the `@hybrid_job` decorator specifies\nthe QPU that the hybrid job will have priority access to. The device\nstring you give is accessible in the hybrid job instance as the\nenvironment variable `AMZN_BRAKET_DEVICE_ARN`.\n\nWhen using on-demand simulators or [embedded\nsimulators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/pennylane-embedded-simulators.html),\nyou may provide the device argument as string of the form:\n`\"local:<provider>/<simulator_name>\"` or simply `None`. For example, you\nmay set `\"local:pennylane/lightning.qubit\"` for the [PennyLane lightning\nsimulator](https://pennylane.ai/performance).\n\nIn the following code, we annotate the `qubit_rotation` function from\nabove.\n"

        "Running on a QPU with priority \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n\nThe next step is to see how well the qubit rotation works on a real QPU.\nWe create a hybrid job with the Rigetti device as the priority QPU. We\nalso increase the number of steps to 10.\n\nUsing hybrid jobs for iterative algorithms is very beneficial because\nyou retain priority access to the target QPU. So once your quantum tasks\nare created in the hybrid job, they run ahead of other tasks waiting in\nthe *quantum task queue*. This means your algorithm will not be\ninterrupted by other quantum tasks, so it will run more efficiently and\npredictably. Quantum tasks submitted as part of a hybrid job have\npriority, and are aggregated in the *priority task queue*.\n\nHybrid jobs have their own *hybrid jobs queue* so that only a single\nhybrid job can run on a QPU at a time. Each QPU has its own hybrid jobs\nqueue. Note that this is a different queue from the quantum tasks. For a\nsingle quantum circuit, or a batch of circuits, it's recommended to\ncreate quantum tasks instead of hybrid jobs. For more information on\nquantum tasks and hybrid jobs queue see the [Amazon Braket\ndocumentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-task-when.html).\n\nTo get QPU priority, you must ensure that the device ARN used within the\nfunction matches that specified in the decorator.
