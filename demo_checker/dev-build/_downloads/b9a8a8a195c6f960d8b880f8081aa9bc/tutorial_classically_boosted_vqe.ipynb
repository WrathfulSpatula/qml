Posted: 31\nOctober 2022. Last updated: 31 October 2022.*\n\nOne of the most important applications of quantum computers is expected\nto be the computation of ground-state energies of complicated molecules\nand materials. Even though there are already some solid proposals on how\nto tackle these problems when fault-tolerant quantum computation comes\ninto play, we currently live in the [noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era)\nera, meaning that we can only access noisy and limited devices. That is\nwhy a large part of the current research on quantum algorithms is\nfocusing on what can be done with few resources. In particular, most\nproposals rely on variational quantum algorithms (VQA), which are\noptimized classically and adapt to the limitations of the quantum\ndevices. For the specific problem of computing ground-state energies,\nthe paradigmatic algorithm is the [Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n(VQE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver)\nalgorithm.\n\nAlthough VQE is intended to run on NISQ devices, it is nonetheless\nsensitive to noise. This is particularly problematic when applying VQE\nto complicated molecules which requires a large number of gates. As a\nconsequence, several modifications to the original VQE algorithm have\nbeen proposed. These variants are usually intended to improve the\nalgorithm's performance on NISQ-era devices.\n\nIn this demo, we will go through one of these proposals step-by-step:\nthe Classically-Boosted Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CB-VQE).\nImplementing CB-VQE reduces the number of measurements required to\nobtain the ground-state energy with a certain precision. This is done by\nmaking use of classical states, which in this context are product states\nthat can be written as a single [Slater\ndeterminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater_determinant) and that\nalready contain some information about the ground-state of the problem.\nTheir structure allows for efficient classical computation of\nexpectation values. An example of such classical state would be the\n[Hartree-Fock\nstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method), in\nwhich the electrons occupy the molecular orbitals with the lowest\nenergy.\n\n![](../demonstrations/classically_boosted_vqe/CB_VQE.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nWe will restrict ourselves to the $H_2$ molecule for the sake of\nsimplicity. First, we will give a short introduction to how to perform\nstandard VQE for the molecule of interest. For more details, we\nrecommend the tutorial `tutorial_vqe`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"} to\nlearn how to implement VQE for molecules step by step. Then, we will\nimplement the CB-VQE algorithm for the specific case in which we rely\nonly on one classical state\u2060---that being the Hartree-Fock state.\nFinally, we will discuss the number of measurements needed to obtain a\ncertain error-threshold by comparing the two methods.\n\nLet's get started!\n"

        "Prerequisites: Standard VQE\n===========================\n\nIf you are not already familiar with the VQE family of algorithms and\nwish to see how one can apply it to the $H_2$ molecule, feel free to\nwork through the aforementioned demo before reading this section. Here,\nwe will only briefly review the main idea behind standard VQE and\nhighlight the important concepts in connection with CB-VQE.\n\nGiven a Hamiltonian $H$, the main goal of VQE is to find the ground\nstate energy of a system governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n$$H \\vert \\phi \\rangle = E  \\vert \\phi \\rangle.$$\n\nThis corresponds to the problem of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian and\nfinding the smallest eigenvalue. Alternatively, one can formulate the\nproblem using the [variational\nprinciple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_principle), in\nwhich we are interested in minimizing the energy\n\n$$E = \\langle \\phi \\vert H \\vert \\phi \\rangle.$$\n\nIn VQE, we prepare a statevector $\\vert \\phi \\rangle$ by applying the\nparameterized ansatz $A(\\Theta)$, represented by a unitary matrix, to an\ninitial state $\\vert 0 \\rangle^{\\otimes n}$ where $n$ is the number of\nqubits. Then, the parameters $\\Theta$ are optimized to minimize a cost\nfunction, which in this case is the energy:\n\n$$E(\\Theta) = \\langle 0 \\vert^{\\otimes n} A(\\Theta)^{\\dagger} H A(\\Theta) \\vert 0 \\rangle^{\\otimes n}.$$\n\nThis is done using a classical optimization method, which is typically\ngradient descent.\n\nTo implement our example of VQE, we first define the molecular\nHamiltonian for the $H_2$ molecule in the minimal [STO-3G\nbasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STO-nG_basis_sets) using PennyLane\n"

        "Classically-Boosted VQE\n=======================\n\nNow we are ready to present the classically-boosted version of VQE.\n\nThe key of this new method relies on the notion of the [generalized\neigenvalue\nproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenvalue_problem).\nThe main idea is to restrict the problem of finding the ground state to\nan eigenvalue problem in a subspace $\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$ of the\ncomplete Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. If this subspace is spanned by a\ncombination of both classical and quantum states, we can run parts of\nour algorithm on classical hardware and thus reduce the number of\nmeasurements needed to reach a certain precision threshold. The\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem is expressed as\n\n$$\\bar{H} \\vec{v}=  \\lambda \\bar{S} \\vec{v},$$\n\nwhere the matrix $\\bar{S}$ contains the overlaps between the basis\nstates and $\\bar{H}$ is the Hamiltonian $H$ projected into the subspace\nof interest, i.e.\u00a0with the entries\n\n$$\\bar{H}_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\langle \\phi_\\alpha \\vert H \\vert \\phi_\\beta \\rangle,$$\n\nfor all $\\vert \\phi_\\alpha \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\phi_\\beta \\rangle$ in\n$\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$. For a complete orthonormal basis, the overlap\nmatrix $\\bar{S}$ would simply be the identity matrix. However, we need\nto take a more general approach which works for a subspace spanned by\npotentially non-orthogonal states. We can retrieve the representation of\n$S$ by calculating\n\n$$\\bar{S}_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\langle \\phi_\\alpha \\vert \\phi_\\beta \\rangle,$$\n\nfor all $\\vert \\phi_\\alpha \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\phi_\\beta \\rangle$ in\n$\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$.

        "Measurement analysis\n====================\n\nCB-VQE is helpful when it comes to reducing the number of measurements\nthat are required to reach a given precision in the ground state energy.\nIn fact, for very small systems it can be shown that the\nclassically-boosted method reduces the number of required measurements\nby a factor of $1000$.\n\nLet\\'s see if this is the case for the example above. Now that we know\nhow to run standard VQE and CB-VQE algorithms, we can re-run the code\nabove for a finite number of measurements. This is done by specifying\nthe number of shots in the definition of the devices, for example,\n`num_shots = 20`. By doing this, Pennylane will output the expectation\nvalue of the energy computed from a sample of 20 measurements. Then, we\nsimply run both VQE and CB-VQE enough times to obtain statistics on the\nresults.\n\n![](../demonstrations/classically_boosted_vqe/energy_deviation.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"80.0%\"}\n\nIn the plot above, the dashed line corresponds to the true ground state\nenergy of the $H_2$ molecule. In the x-axis we represent the number of\nmeasurements that are used to compute the expected value of the\nHamiltonian ([num\\_shots]{.title-ref}). In the y-axis, we plot the mean\nvalue and the standard deviation of the energies obtained from a sample\nof 100 circuit evaluations. As expected, CB-VQE leads to a better\napproximation of the ground state energy - the mean energies are\nlower-and, most importantly, to a much smaller standard deviation,\nimproving on the results given by standard VQE by several orders of\nmagnitude when considering a small number of measurements. As expected,\nfor a large number of measurements both algorithms start to converge to\nsimilar results and the standard deviation decreases.\n\n[Note: In order to obtain these results, we had to discard the samples\nin which the VQE shot noise underestimated the true ground state energy\nof the problem, since this was leading to large variances in the CB-VQE\nestimation of the energy.]{.title-ref}\n"

Furthermore, it was observed that we require fewer\nmeasurements to be executed on a quantum computer to reach the same\naccuracy as standard VQE. Such algorithms could be executed on smaller\nquantum computers, potentially allowing us to implement useful quantum\nalgorithms on real hardware sooner than expected.\n"
