        "Initial state preparation for quantum chemistry\n===============================================\n\nA high-quality initial state can significantly reduce the runtime of\nmany quantum algorithms. From the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)\nto quantum phase estimation (QPE) and even the recent\n[intermediate-scale quantum\n(ISQ)](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2023/06/from-nisq-to-isq/) algorithms,\nobtaining the ground state of a chemical system requires a good initial\nstate. For instance, in the case of VQE, a good initial state directly\ntranslates into fewer optimization steps. In QPE, the probability of\nmeasuring the ground-state energy is directly proportional to the\noverlap squared of the initial and ground states. Even beyond quantum\nchemistry, good initial guesses are important for algorithms like\nquantum approximate optimization (QAOA) and Grover search.\n\nMuch like searching for a needle in a haystack, there are a lot of\nthings you might try to prepare a good guess for the ground state in the\nhigh-dimensional Hilbert space. In this tutorial, we show how to use\ntraditional computational chemistry techniques to get a good initial\nstate. Such an initial state will not be exactly the ground state, but\nit will certainly be better than the standard guess of a computational\nbasis state $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ or the Hartree-Fock state.\n\n![](../demonstrations/initial_state_preparation/qchem_input_states.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"65.0%\"}\n\nImporting initial states\n------------------------\n\nWe can import initial states obtained from several post-Hartree-Fock\nquantum chemistry methods to PennyLane. These methods are incredibly\ndiverse in terms of their outputs, not always returning an object that\nis easy to turn into a PennyLane state vector.\n\nWe have already done this hard conversion work: all that you need to do\nis run these methods and pass their outputs to PennyLane\\'s\n`~.pennylane.qchem.import_state`{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"}\nfunction. The currently supported methods are configuration interaction\nwith singles and doubles (CISD), coupled cluster (CCSD), density-matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) and semistochastic heat-bath configuration\ninteraction (SHCI).\n\nWe now show how this works on the linear $\\text{H}_3^+$ molecule as an\nexample.\n\n### CISD states\n\nThe first line of attack for initial state preparation is often a CISD\ncalculation, performed with the [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf)\nlibrary. CISD is unsophisticated, but it is fast. It will not be of much\nhelp for strongly correlated molecules, but it is better than\nHartree-Fock. Here is the code example using the restricted Hartree-Fock\norbitals (`~.pennylane.qchem.import_state`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"func\"} works for unrestricted orbitals, too).\n"

With these initial states, we use the example of VQE to\ndemonstrate how a better choice of initial state can lead to improved\nalgorithmic performance. For the molecule used in our example, the CISD\nstate was sufficient: however, in more correlated molecules, DMRG and\nSHCI initial states typically provide the best speed-ups.\n\nAbout the author\n================\n"
